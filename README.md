# animation proposal
This project is a simple, fun Valentine's Day proposal web page with interactive elements. It features a "Yes" and "No" button, a confirmation popup, and a heart animation effect.

## Features
* **Proposal with Yes/No Buttons:** Presents a Valentine's Day proposal with clear "Yes" and "No" options.
* **"Yes" Button Interaction:**
    * Triggers a popup message: "Happy Valentine's Day!".
    * Upon clicking "OK" in the popup, a cascade of animated hearts is displayed on the screen.
* **"No" Button Interaction:**
    * The "No" button dynamically moves away from the user's cursor, making it playfully difficult to click.
